BASH :
 A bash script is a file containing a sequence of commands that are executed by the bash program line by line.

Bash isn't just for serious coding sessions,it's got its playful side too! 
Here is a collection, which I will make over time, of scripts in bash to automate some steps.

 * buttonWiFi.sh - Automating the WiFi connection of the host computer
 * digi_clock.sh - Digital clock in computer in which we can also change themes
 * diskspace.sh  - Find out the disk space of the host computer
 * pwdgenerator.sh - Generate the 'n' number of passwords 
 * showip.sh - shows the internet protocol address
